# Challenge-2

Attahced is my complted challenge 2 folder.

The header contains the nav bar. Each of the elements in the nav bar can be clied to direct the user to the associated portion of the webpage.

The webpage contains responsive design that resizes itself based on the browsers window. It can also resize itself to mobile devices, allowing the content to be viewed more easily.

The work sections contains 5 elements that can detect when the mouse hovers over them. These images can be interacted with as well. Since i do not have any completed projects yet, a placeholder screenshot and link was used.

The contact me sections features hyperlinks that can direct the user to their respective sites.
